        <h2 id="ENGLISH">ENGLISH</h2>
            <p>English is a global language and a powerful tool of communication that plays a vital role in the academic and professional development of students. In English class, students are taught how to read with comprehension, write effectively, and express themselves with confidence. The curriculum includes grammar, vocabulary, prose, poetry, and essay writing. Special emphasis is laid on enhancing the listening and speaking skills of students through interactive sessions, role-playing, debates, and presentations. Reading classic and contemporary literature helps students build empathy, cultural understanding, and critical thinking. English also sharpens the creative skills of students by encouraging them to write stories, poems, and personal reflections. As the most widely used language across the world, English not only helps students excel in their studies but also opens up doors to global opportunities in the future.</p>
        <h2 id="TAMIL">TAMIL</h2>
            <p>Tamil, one of the oldest living languages in the world, holds a rich cultural and historical significance. In Tamil class, students explore the beauty and depth of classical Tamil literature, modern prose, poetry, and grammar. The curriculum is designed to improve the reading, writing, and speaking abilities of students in their mother tongue, while also instilling a strong appreciation for Tamil culture and heritage. Students learn the importance of language in expressing emotions, preserving traditions, and building community identity. Through essays, stories, and poems, learners engage with the language in creative and meaningful ways. Tamil class not only enhances linguistic skills but also promotes moral values and social awareness through the wisdom embedded in ancient texts and folk literature. Mastery in Tamil helps students connect with their roots and gain confidence in both local and academic platforms.</p>
        <h2 id="SCIENCE">SCIENCE</h2>
            <p>Science is the foundation of logical reasoning and modern innovation. In science class, students dive into the wonders of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. They learn how the natural world works — from the movement of planets to the structure of atoms, from bodily systems to chemical reactions. The subject nurtures curiosity, observation, and experimentation through lab activities and real-life applications. It promotes inquiry-based learning where students ask questions, form hypotheses, conduct experiments, and analyze results. By understanding scientific principles, students are encouraged to think critically and solve everyday problems. Science also plays a major role in developing environmental awareness and responsible decision-making in health, hygiene, and technology use. This subject not only prepares students for careers in engineering, medicine, and research but also shapes them into informed global citizens capable of making evidence-based choices.</p>
        <h2 id="P.E.T">P.E.T (Physical Education Training)</h2>
            <p>Physical Education Training (P.E.T) is essential for the physical, mental, and emotional development of students. In P.E.T class, students participate in various physical activities such as running, yoga, stretching, sports, and group exercises. The primary aim is to promote health, fitness, and body coordination. Regular exercise helps improve concentration, reduce stress, and build self-confidence. Students are taught the importance of discipline, teamwork, leadership, and sportsmanship. Games and competitions also foster healthy competition and social bonding among peers. Physical Education is not just about staying fit; it’s about developing a lifestyle of wellness, resilience, and positivity. In today’s digital age, where students spend long hours sitting and looking at screens, P.E.T offers the perfect balance by encouraging movement, energy, and holistic well-being.</p>
        <h2 id="MATHS">MATHS</h2>
            <p>Mathematics is the language of logic and the key to understanding the structure of the world around us. In math class, students develop problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and numerical ability. The curriculum includes basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, statistics, and data interpretation. Students are trained to think logically, reason quantitatively, and solve complex problems with clarity and precision. Math builds a strong foundation for academic excellence and is essential in fields like engineering, economics, architecture, and data science. Beyond academics, math is used in daily life — from budgeting money to measuring ingredients. The subject helps students understand patterns, make predictions, and think creatively in structured ways. With consistent practice and guidance, math not only becomes an interesting subject but also a powerful tool for success in every walk of life.</p>
        <h2 id="SOCIAL">SOCIAL</h2>
            <p>Social Science is a subject that helps students understand human society, its history, culture, geography, and governance. It is a combination of History, Geography, Civics, and Economics. Through Social Studies, students learn about the past events that shaped the world, the functioning of governments and democratic rights, the importance of natural resources, and how economies work. This subject develops critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and awareness about the role of individuals in society. It promotes responsible citizenship, tolerance, and respect for diversity. Students also explore contemporary issues such as globalization, climate change, and human rights. Social Science teaches valuable life lessons and helps young minds to form opinions based on facts and compassion. It empowers students to understand the world they live in and prepares them to participate actively and meaningfully in community life.</p>
